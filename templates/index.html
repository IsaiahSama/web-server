<p>Hello and welcome to your very own webserver😁 (designed by Isaiah Carrington. Perhaps check out some more of his stuff on his <a href="https://isaiahsama.github.io/">website</a>)</p>

<p>I am well aware the website isn't anything fancy, but it is functional😉</p>

<p>Since you're here, I assume that you know what this is and the general idea of what you're capable of doing here. Awesome. Everything can be accessed from below</p>

<h2>File Upload</h2>
<p>Ready to upload some files? Just press <a href="/upload/">here</a> to get started.</p>

<h2>{% if session.name %} {{ session.name }}'s {% else %} Your {% endif %} Files</h2>

{% if files %}

    {{ files }}

{% else %}
    <p>You haven't uploaded any files as yet. Do so by pressing the <a href="/upload/"> upload</a> link above</p>
{% endif %}

{% if session.name %}
    <a href="/forgetme/">Forget I told you my name</a>
